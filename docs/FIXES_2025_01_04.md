# Fixes Applied - January 4, 2025

This document summarizes all fixes and improvements made to LavaMusic on January 4, 2025.

## 🎯 Summary

- ✅ Fixed text channel notification configuration
- ✅ Fixed 24/7 mode dashboard integration
- ✅ Downloaded and configured Lavalink v4.1.1
- ✅ Created database and applied schema

---

## 1. Text Channel Notification Fix

### Problem
The bot was not respecting the configured text channel setting (e.g., "bot-commands") for notifications. Messages were always sent to the channel where commands were executed, ignoring the dashboard configuration.

### Root Cause
- Commands created players with `ctx.channel.id` instead of checking database
- Existing players never updated their text channel, even when settings changed
- Dashboard configuration existed but was never used by Discord commands

### Solution

#### Created Utility Function
**File**: `src/utils/functions/ensurePlayerTextChannel.ts`

```typescript
export async function ensurePlayerTextChannel(
    client: Lavamusic,
    player: Player | undefined,
    guildId: string
): Promise<void>
```

This function:
- Checks database for configured text channel
- Updates existing player if channel differs
- Logs updates for debugging

#### Updated Commands (9 files)
Modified to check database when creating players:
- `Play.ts` - Main play command
- `Join.ts` - Join voice channel
- `PlayNext.ts` - Play song next in queue
- `Say.ts` - Text-to-speech command
- `PlayLocal.ts` - Play local file
- `Search.ts` - Search for songs
- `Radio.ts` - Radio stations
- `247.ts` - 24/7 mode
- `Load.ts` - Load playlist

#### Updated Events
- `TrackStart.ts` - Ensures player uses configured channel before sending notifications
- Existing players automatically update on every track start

#### Updated Web API
- `api.ts` - Guild info endpoint updates player channel

### Benefits
- ✅ Immediate effect - no restart needed
- ✅ Works from Discord commands and dashboard
- ✅ Smart fallback to current channel if not configured
- ✅ Console logging for verification
- ✅ Existing players automatically updated

### Testing
```bash
# 1. Configure text channel via dashboard
# 2. Run !play from any channel
# 3. Notifications appear in configured channel

# Console output:
[TextChannel] Updated player text channel for guild 123456789 to 987654321
```

## 2. 24/7 Mode Dashboard Fix

### Problem
Enabling 24/7 mode through the web dashboard didn't work. Bot would still stop playing when left alone in voice channel.

### Root Cause
**Inconsistent storage locations**:
- Dashboard: Saved to player object (`player.set('247', enabled)`)
- Discord command: Saved to database (`client.db.set_247()`)
- VoiceStateUpdate: Checked database (`client.db.get_247()`)

Dashboard setting was never persisted to database, so it was never checked!

### Solution

#### Updated POST Endpoint
**File**: `src/web/routes/api.ts`
**Endpoint**: `POST /guilds/:guildId/settings/247`

```typescript
// Enable 24/7
if (enabled) {
    const player = client.manager.getPlayer(guildId);
    if (!player) {
        throw error('Player must be active to enable 24/7 mode');
    }
    await client.db.set_247(guildId, player.textChannelId, player.voiceChannelId);
}

// Disable 24/7
else {
    await client.db.delete_247(guildId);
}
```

#### Updated GET Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /guilds/:guildId/settings`

```typescript
// Read from database (not player)
const is247 = await client.db.get_247(guildId);
return {
    '247': !!is247,
    autoplay: player?.get('autoplay') || false,
    volume: player?.volume || 50
};
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Dashboard and Discord command use same storage
- ✅ Settings persist across bot restarts
- ✅ Consistent behavior regardless of toggle method
- ✅ Proper validation (requires active player)

### Testing
```bash
# 1. Start music
# 2. Enable 24/7 via dashboard
# 3. Leave voice channel
# Result: Bot continues playing ✅

# 4. Disable 24/7 via dashboard
# 5. Leave voice channel
# Result: Bot stops after 5 seconds ✅
```
